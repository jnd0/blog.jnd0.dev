## My first post

Hello, if you made it here Welcome! 
I'm so happy to be writing this lines. I've been visualizing this moment in a long time, and it is finally happening right now. 

### What is the story?

This all started when I was at University and the new web frameworks were being developed. There was this consensus sentiment in the dev community that you had to have your own website / blog to show and share all the thing you've work on to attract companies and have it easier when looking for a job after. Long story short I ended up landing in a job having a really "crappy" website without building what I wanted to build back then.   

### Why bother creating a blog?

Knowledge needs to be shared, the older we get the more knowledge we have, the World Wide Web is undoubtedly the biggest source of information available right now. 

Studies have shown that the best way to learn and be proficient on something is actually by teaching it. By keeping this blog up and running I hope to inspire or teach someone something they are looking for by sharing what I know and as a consequence become more proficient on the topic.  

All that said I would like this to be also a way to keep myself motivated and accountable to learn and share all the cutting edge research and new technologies in the web space.  

### What is this going to be then?

I would like to be sort of an open window to the world where I can share my thoughts and learnings for someonelse to benefit from them. 

### Why having your personal blog when there're platforms specifically made for that?

Because is yours, you own it, it is your website and your content. I know that I could possibly write the same stuff in leading blogs like [dev.to](https://dev.to), [medium](https://medium.com). Well, we all know what happened to medium...

### How long can I expect new content?

I would try at the beginning to get at least a new post every 2-3 weeks. At least once a month minimum.
