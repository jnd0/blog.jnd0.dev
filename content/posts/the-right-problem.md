To succeed in today's fast-paced world, it's not enough to work hard. You also need to make sure that your efforts are in line with what people need and want.
It's not enough to just be passionate about your work. You also need to understand the problems your target audience is facing and make sure your product or service addresses those problem
## Finding the Right Problem

One must conduct thorough user research, perform detailed market analysis, and keenly observe user behaviour. The launch of Google Glass serves as a cautionary exampleThe debut of Google Glass stands as a valuable lesson in product development and market reception. Despite significant efforts and resources invested in its development, the product failed to deliver tangible benefits to users. This failure is largely attributed to a lack of focus on solving the right problems, or in this case the product being launched ahead of it’s time, leading to wasted time and resources. Google Glass did not adequately address real user needs or consider the social implications of the technology, resulting in poor adoption and eventual discontinuation.

## Finding the Right Soultion
In contrast, many successful software companies prioritise solving real-world problems that users need. They invest heavily in understanding their users' needs and desires, which enables them to develop products and features that resonate with the market. For example, Zoom addressed the need for reliable and user-friendly video conferencing, especially as remote work surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. By focusing on ease of use, high-quality video, and seamless connectivity, Zoom became an essential tool for businesses, schools, and individuals. The ability to identify and work on the right problems is a rare skill that sets exceptional engineers and business leaders apart from the rest. It requires a combination of technical expertise, business acumen, and a deep understanding of human behaviour.

Moreover, this skill is not static but rather evolves over time. It necessitates continuous learning, experimentation, and a willingness to adapt to changing market dynamics. Therefore, it is imperative to embrace a problem-centric mindset. Focusing on understanding the root causes of issues and developing solutions that address them effectively as well as leveraging the latest development in technologies (for example now AI) to create innovative solutions. This requires a deep understanding of the user's context, needs, and goals. It also involves actively seeking out and listening to feedback from users, as well as being up to date with the latest technical developments and conducting thorough research and analysis.

By embracing a problem-centric approach, we can create solutions that are not only technically sound but also user-centred and effective in solving real-world problems.
